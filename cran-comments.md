# tidySEM 0.1.7

* Fixed several bugs in plotting (introduced in 0.1.6),
  caused by multiple columns called "label" 
  generated by mplus and lavaan, which overlap with the "label" column used for
  plotting. Renamed other "label" columns to "mplus_label" and "lavaan_label"
* Fixed bug where arguments were not passed from prepare_graph() and graph_sem()
  to get_nodes() and get_edges(), e.g., digits was not passed on
* Fixed bug where linetype did not work when using a mix of numeric (e.g., 1) 
  and character (e.g., "dashed") values
* Node labels can now be customized just like edge labels
* Added convenience functions to conditionally customize graphs based on
  if_edit(), e.g.: sig_colour(plot, "green")
* Improved functionality of edit_graph() methods
* Added wrappers for edit_graph(): edit_edges() and edit_nodes()
* graph_sem(fix_coord = TRUE) now works for multi-group models
